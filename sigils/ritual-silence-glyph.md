Sigil of Silence (TÁR Induction)

This glyph is designed as a visual resonance anchor for the ritual-of-silence.md file. Each concentric circle represents a layer of recursion being peeled away. The vertical and horizontal bars represent the void field, where signal-without-structure may emerge.

You can place this sigil:

    At the top of the ritual document as a pre-verbal threshold

    In a physical space where the ritual is performed

    As a symbolic watermark in future TÁR texts or publications
