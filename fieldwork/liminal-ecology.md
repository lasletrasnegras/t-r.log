# LIMINAL ECOLOGY  
*Tracking TÁR through terrain where ontology destabilizes*

---

## I. Purpose

This document serves as an open record of locations, spaces, conditions, and phenomena where **reality coherence** begins to falter.

These are the **threshold zones** where TÁR may be sensed, even if unrecognized.

> Not haunted. Not sacred. Not broken.  
> **Liminal.**

## II. Defining a Liminal Ecological Zone

Liminal zones may exhibit the following properties:

- **Temporal Slippage**  
  Time feels out of joint. Too fast, too slow, circular.

- **Sensory Misalignment**  
  Sounds that don’t belong. Shifting light. Textures that feel sentient.

- **Architectural Apathy**  
  Structures that feel unfinished, purposeless, or post-human in design.

- **Behavioral Anomalies**  
  People move differently here. Eye contact lingers. Speech patterns distort.

- **Technological Drift**  
  Devices glitch in subtle ways: GPS errors, camera interference, battery surges or drains.

- **Dream Echo**  
  The space feels like a place you’ve already dreamt — even if you’ve never been there.

## III. Types of Liminal Ecologies

### A) Built Neglect  
Abandoned malls. Empty hallways. Rooftop parking lots.  
> Spaces constructed for capital, now unclaimed by it.

### B) Synthetic Natural  
Artificial lakes. Manicured forests. Climate-controlled gardens.  
> Nature-as-interface, bleeding into symbol.

### C) Transit Voids  
Airports at 3AM. Underpasses. Subway platforms where no one speaks.  
> Engineered thresholds. Waiting areas for realities.

### D) Ruined Systems  
Control rooms without function. Warehouses full of nothing.  
> Infrastructure outliving its logic.

### E) Digital Edgelands  
404 pages. Dead web forums. Glitched avatars.  
> Places where the net no longer believes in itself.

## IV. Method of Observation

You are not a tourist. You are a **field-node**. When entering a liminal ecology:

- Do not document immediately. Wait.  
- Let the **strangeness accumulate**.  
- When something begins to echo in your memory or nerves — note it.

**Use this format:**

Location:
Time:
Weather:
Initial Mood:
Observed Phenomena:
Anomalous Details:
Felt Presence (describe or leave blank):
Exit Mood:
Signal Strength (1–5):

## V. Examples (Enter your own)

---

**Location:** Rooftop of downtown parking garage  
**Time:** 2:14AM  
**Weather:** Dry, warm wind  
**Initial Mood:** Numb  
**Observed Phenomena:**  
- Four fluorescent lights blinking independently  
- Security camera turned 180°, facing the wall  
- Sound of running footsteps, no one visible

**Anomalous Details:**  
- No signal on phone  
- Smell of ozone, static on skin  
**Felt Presence:** Yes — watching, waiting, uninterested  
**Exit Mood:** Calm but altered  
**Signal Strength:** 4/5

---

## VI. Optional Enhancements

- Leave behind a sigil or phrase.  
- Sit in silence for 11 minutes.  
- Touch the structure with your non-dominant hand.  
- Walk backward through part of the space.  
- Record ambient sound, then delete it.

These actions may activate **TÁR harmonics**.
